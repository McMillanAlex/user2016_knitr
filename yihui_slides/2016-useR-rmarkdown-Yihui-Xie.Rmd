# Part I: An introduction to R Markdown

- Pandoc's Markdown syntax, e.g. how to write citations, tables, raw LaTeX/HTML, etc
- An overview of R Markdown output formats (HTML, PDF, Word, presentations, and so on)
- How to customize existing output formats
    - Basic format options, e.g. TOC, numbered/unnumbered sections, etc
    - Pandoc templates (how to write a template and apply it, how to pass variables to Pandoc templates)
    - Customize CSS for HTML output
    - Customize LaTeX preamble for PDF output
    - Customize Word templates (header/footer, font styles, etc)

# No cut-and-paste

> - If you finished a data analysis project via the cut-and-paste approach in a week, you are likely to do everything manually again for another week in the future, e.g., when the source data has been updated, or a parameter needs to be changed, etc. It is tedious and error-prone to repeat the work (also difficult for others to reproduce the results).

# Basic ideas of dynamic documents

- Literate Programming (Donald Knuth)
- code + narratives = report
- i.e. computing languages + authoring languages

        We built a linear regression model.

        `r ''````{r}
        fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
        b   <- coef(fit)
        plot(fit)
        `r ''```

        The slope of the regression is `r '\x60r b[1]\x60'`.

- "dynamic" means the computing/output is dynamic, instead of dynamic content like animations in documents

# Markdown

- A very simple authoring language
- Yihui's personal award: if you cannot learn the basics of Markdown in X minutes (X >= 5), he will award you X dollars
- R Markdown cheetsheet: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ (you may get some from RStudio's booth)

# Original Markdown

- primarily for HTML
- paragraphs, `# headers`, `> blockquotes`
- `**bold**`, `_italic_`
- `- lists`
- `[text](url)`
- `![text](image)`
- code blocks (indent by four spaces)

# Pandoc's Markdown

<!--
* Briefly explain the .bib database here for citations.
* Show different output formats and how to set options by clicking the gear button in RStudio.
-->

- Markdown extensions
    - tables
    - LaTeX math `$\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i$` = $\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i$
    - YAML metadata
    - raw HTML/LaTeX (limitation: raw HTML only works for HTML output, and raw LaTeX only for LaTeX/PDF output)

            <div class="my-class">
              ![image](url)
            </div>

            _emphasis_ and \emph{emphasis}

    - footnotes `^[A footnote here.]`
    - citations `[@joe2014]`
    - syntax highlighting of code blocks (three backticks followed by the language name, e.g. ```` ```r ````)
- types of output documents
    - LaTeX/PDF
    - beamer
    - HTML
    - ioslides
    - Slidy
    - reveal.js
    - Word (MS Word, OpenOffice)
    - E-books
    - ...
- see example pandoc-markdown.Rmd

# The rmarkdown package

- Pandoc is a command-line tool
- without **rmarkdown**, you have to call **knitr** and Pandoc separately, e.g.

    ```r
    # in R
    library(knitr)
    knit('input.Rmd')  # -> input.md
    ```

    ```bash
    # in command line
    pandoc -t beamer -o output.pdf --smart input.md
    ```

- Pandoc has more than 70 command line arguments
- **knitr** has about 50 chunk options
- **rmarkdown** provides wrappers that produce reasonably beautiful output by default
    - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [themes](http://bootswatch.com/)
    - highlight.js for syntax highlighting in HTML
- you can specify a lot of Pandoc and **knitr** options using the R syntax, e.g. Pandoc argument `--toc` corresponds to `toc = TRUE` in **rmarkdown** (similarly, `fig_width = 5` in **rmarkdown** corresponds to `opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 5)` in **knitr**)

# Using rmarkdown

- command-line usage

    ```r
    library(rmarkdown)
    render('input.Rmd')
    render('input.Rmd', pdf_document())
    render('input.Rmd', word_document())
    render('input.Rmd', beamer_presentation())
    render('input.Rmd', ioslides_presentation())
    ```

- use the RStudio IDE (click the Knit button)

# Basic format options

- table of contents
- numbered/unnumbered sections
- self-contained output document
- global figure width/height
- two ways to specify options:
    - YAML metadata in R Markdown documents (recommended)

        ```yaml
        ---
        output:
          html_document:
            toc: true
            number_sections: true
            fig_height: 6
        ---
        ```

    - pass to **rmarkdown** output format functions

        ```r
        rmarkdown::render(
          'input.Rmd', html_document(
            toc = TRUE,
            number_sections = TRUE,
            fig_height = 6
          )
        )
        ```

# Customize CSS for HTML output

- the appearance of HTML output documents is controlled by CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
- you can pass a CSS file to the `css` argument of the output format, e.g.

    ```yaml
    ---
    output:
      html_document:
        css: my_style.css
    ---
    ```

- a simple example of `my_style.css` (change the font size of the second level headers to be 30px)

    ```css
    h2 {
      font-size: 30px;
    }
    ```

# Customize LaTeX preamble for PDF output

- use the `includes` option to add more stuff to the LaTeX output
- typically you want to use the sub-option `in_header` to customize the LaTeX preamble, e.g.

    ```yaml
    ---
    output:
      pdf_document:
        includes:
          in_header: my_preamble.tex
    ---
    ```

- `my_preamble.tex` may load more LaTeX packages, set options, and so on, e.g.

    ```tex
    \usepackage{booktabs}
    \usepackage{ctexcap}
    ```

# Pandoc templates

If none of the existing options can give you the output you desire, you can simply replace the Pandoc template, which allows you to customize everything.

When Pandoc converts Markdown to another output format, it uses a template under the hood (specified via the `--template` option of Pandoc, or `template` argument of most output format functions in **rmarkdown**).

The template is a plain text file that contains some variables of the form `$variable$`. These variables will be replaced by their values generated by Pandoc.

A minimal HTML template:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>$title$</title>
  </head>

  <body>
  $body$
  </body>
</html>
```

Variables are typically read from the YAML metadata of the Markdown document, such as `$title$`, e.g.

```yaml
---
title: A _Nice_ Markdown Document
---
```

The value of a variable can be different for different output formats, e.g. `$title$` is **`A \emph{Nice} Markdown Document`** when the output format is LaTeX, and **`A <em>Nice</em> Markdown Document`** for HTML output.

- **rmarkdown**'s default templates: https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/tree/master/inst/rmd


# Journal articles

- the **rticles** package https://github.com/rstudio/rticles
- `install.packages('rticles')`
- different (LaTeX) templates for different journals
- demo (Journal of Statistical Software)

<!--
** You can just use the Rmd skeleton that can be created from RStudio's menu: File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Templates -> Journal of Statistical Software. **
-->


# Customize Word templates

- a Word document is not a plain-text file, so you cannot create a template like most other formats
- you can still customize the styles of header/footer, font styles, etc, of the Word output
    1. generate a Word output document from an arbitrary R Markdown document (`output: word_document`);
    1. open the Word document, and edit the styles in it;
    1. save the document, and use it as the template for future R Markdown document;

        ```yaml
        ---
        output:
          word_document:
            reference_docx: my_template.docx
        ---
        ```

# Part II: New output formats

- A closer look at the structure of an output format object
    - **knitr** options (chunk options, hooks, etc)
    - Pandoc options
    - pre/post-processor functions
- Examples of new formats, e.g. `html_vignette()` and the **tufte** package (`tufte::tufte_html()`, and `tufte::tufte_handout()`)
- How to author a long-form document using **bookdown**
    - Cross-references of figures/tables/sections
    - Separate HTML pages for chapters

# What is an output format?

Take `html_document()` for example:

```{r comment=''}
str(rmarkdown::html_document(), 2)
```

It is a list of **knitr** and Pandoc options, plus some functions (pre/post processors). This list is typically generated by `rmarkdown::output_format()`. Type `rmarkdown::html_document` or `rmarkdown::pdf_document` in the R console, and take a look at the last few lines of the source code.

# Examples of new output formats

- Simple ones (read the R source code):
    - `rmarkdown::html_vignette`: the key idea is to get rid of the large Bootstrap dependency (`theme = NULL`) to reduce the R package size, then apply a lightweight CSS theme (`vignette.css` in **rmarkdown**) to the HTML output
    - `rmarkdown::rtf_document`: specify the output format to be `rtf` (`pandoc_options(to = 'rtf')`)
    - you can use the same idea to write an output format function for EPUB ebooks: just change `rtf` to `epub` or `epub3`, and you may also add more options specific to EPUB (such as the cover image)

<!--
** The source code of the tufte package may be a little overwhelming for the audience to read line-by-line, and you may only address the post_processor function, e.g. what tufte_html() does is to take the HTML output from Pandoc, parse the figure/table captions, footnotes, and references, modify the HTML to place them in the margin. The modified HTML is written back to the original HTML output file. **
-->
- More complicated ones:
    - the **tufte** package: `tufte::tufte_html`, `tufte::tufte_handout`
    - source code at https://github.com/rstudio/tufte/
    - these output format functions are a little hackish: instead of using the public API `rmarkdown::output_format()` to specify the output format, they are based on existing formats `html_document()` and `pdf_document()`, and modify the lists afterwards
    - `tufte_handout` modified the `plot` chunk hook of **knitr** to support new chunk options `fig.margin = TRUE` and `fig.fullwidth = TRUE`
    - `tufte_html` applied a new CSS file (`tufte.css`) to the HTML output, and heavily hacked the HTML output using a post-processor to place captions, footnotes and references in the margin
    - demo http://rstudio.github.io/tufte

        ```r
        if (!require('tufte')) install.packages('tufte')

        file.edit(
          system.file(
            'rmarkdown', 'templates', 'tufte_html', 'skeleton', 'skeleton.Rmd',
            package = 'tufte'
          )
        )
        ```

<!--
** Demonstrate both HTML and PDF output. Also show responsiveness of the HTML page. It may be worth showing the source code of some helper functions like tufte::newthought (different output depending on the output format). **
-->

# bookdown

- process _multiple_ R Markdown documents (e.g. book chapters, course notes, and so on) to HTML/PDF/EPUB
- source code: https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown (not on CRAN, so `devtools::install_github('rstudio/bookdown')`)
- documentation: https://bookdown.org
- you will hear more about it in the talk "Authoring Books with R Markdown" on Thursday
- the **bookdown** package provided a few new formats:
    - `gitbook`/`html_book`
    - `pdf_book`
    - `epub_book`
- you may read the source code if you are interested in the implementation, and these formats primarily used a post-processor function to post-process the HTML/LaTeX output to, for example, split the HTML output into multiple pages, number figures/tables, resolve cross-references, and so on
- no advanced R programming techniques involved -- mostly character string manipulations (`grep()`, `gsub()`, `gregexpr()`, `regmatches()`, ...)
- demo https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo

# Part III: Other applications

- Build websites
- Interactive Shiny documents
- HTML widgets
- Code chunks of other languages

# Build websites

- render multiple R Markdown documents to a website of multiple pages
- `rmarkdown::render_site`
- minimal requirements: `index.(R)md` and `_site.yml`
- RStudio (currently [preview version](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/), e.g. 0.99.1242) can automatically detect R Markdown website _projects_, and you can use the `Build` button to build the website
- demo site.Rproj

# Interactive Shiny documents

- you can embed shiny apps in R Markdown
- write UI/server logic code directly in R code chunks, instead of separate R scripts
- the output document is essentially a Shiny app, so requires a running R session (unlike typical R Markdown output documents, which are static HTML/PDF files)
- demo

<!--
** You can just use the default Shiny document provided in RStudio: File -> New File -> R Markdown -> Shiny. **
-->

# HTML widgets

- you will learn more about this in Ramnath's talk "htmlwidgets: Power of JavaScript in R" on Tuesday
- the `inst/htmlwidgets` directory (JS/CSS dependencies) in a package
    - the YAML spec file
- R binding `htmlwidgets::createWidget()`
    - pass data and options from R to the JS side
    - when rendering a widget in R Markdown, **knitr** will collect the dependency objects, analyze the files required by dependencies, and copy them from packages to the output directory
    - dependencies are created by `htmltools::htmlDependency()`
- JS binding (to render the R data)

```js
HTMLWidgets.widget({

  name: "FOO",

  type: "output",

  initialize: function(el, width, height) {
    // initialize the element
  },

  renderValue: function(el, data, instance) {
    // render the data in el, e.g.
    // $(el).DataTable(data.options);
  }

})
```

- one widget object, works everywhere
    - R console / RStudio
    - R Markdown
    - Shiny
- http://htmlwidgets.org
- demo htmlwidgets.Rmd
<!--
** This demo requires a bunch of R packages. **
-->

# Run code from other languages in R Markdown

- although **knitr** was designed primarily for executing R code in dynamic documents, it also has limited support for other languages, such as C, Fortran, C++/Rcpp, Python, and so on
- instead of ```` ```{r} ````, use ```` ```{lang} ````, where `lang` is the language name (e.g. ```` ```{Rcpp} ````); currently supported languages are

    ```{r R.options=list(width=50)}
    sort(names(knitr::knit_engines$get()))
    ```

- they are not as well supported as R; typically these code chunks are executed simply via `system()`, e.g. a Python code chunk **`print(1)`** is executed as **`system("python -c 'print(1)'")`** in R, and the text output (as side effects) is collected

<!--
** You may briefly demo, e.g. ```{python}
Plenty of examples at https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/ (search for "engine" in the list) **
-->

# Summary

- dynamic documents make it easier to repeat/reproduce your data analysis
- Markdown is simple, and Pandoc added a lot of useful features
- rmarkdown provided a few basic output formats based on Pandoc, and is also extensible (change options, create templates, build new formats, etc)
- there are some existing rmarkdown extensions, e.g. **rticles**, **bookdown**, **tufte**, ...
- you can build websites, render HTML widgets, embed Shiny applications, and execute code of other languages in R Markdown

Download fruit snacks data to a file.

```{python download_data}
import urllib.request

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbroman/FruitSnacks/master/Data/fruit_snacks.csv"
file = "fruit_snacks.csv"

with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response, open(file, "wb") as ofp:
    data = response.read()
    ofp.write(data)
```

Read the file and print a couple of things.  Note that each python
code chunk is a separate process, with no shared information.

```{python read_file}
file = "fruit_snacks.csv"
with open(file) as fp:
    header = fp.readline().strip().split(',')

    x = []
    for line in fp:
        v = line.strip().split(',')
        x.append(v)

print("column names:   " + " ".join(header))
print("number of rows: " + str(len(x)))
````

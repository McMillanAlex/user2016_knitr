## What it does

Start by downloading the [demo](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo) and installing the bookdown package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Look at the chapter numbering system and the convention for starting a new chapter (including label/references)

```
# Introduction {#intro}

Here we introduce some crucially important topics...
```

## How it does it

Have a look at the [source code](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/blob/master/R/gitbook.R) for the gitbook() function. You will see code to post-proceess the HTML to split into multiple pages, do the numbering and resolve cross-references, etc.

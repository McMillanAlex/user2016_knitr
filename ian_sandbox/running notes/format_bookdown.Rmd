Download with the demo:

https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo

```{r eval=FALSE}
install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Download it and start fiddling around. Show how adding a new chapter is a matter of creating a new Rmd file (use number as a way to assemble chapters in correct order).

Show the source code for gitbook.

Remind of Hadley's presentation on Thursday.

Clone it and start fiddling around.

There are three crucial files:

* `index.Rmd` (section 1.3)
    - this can have a yml block to describe options for the whole book
    - alternatively, can specify in `_output.yml` (Chapter 3)
* `_bookdown.yml` (section 1.4)
    - other configuration information

One way to name the following chapters is to use leading digits, i.e. `01-introduction`.

title: Notes on Yihui's notes
---

This will be a way for me to capture my questions, and possibly insights as I bash my way through Yihui's presentation.

The first thing to remind myself of - the minimal set for `rmarkdown::render_site()` to work is:

* a `_site.yml` file
* an `index.(R)md` file

It would be a neat exercise to have someone in the class suggest a theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/).

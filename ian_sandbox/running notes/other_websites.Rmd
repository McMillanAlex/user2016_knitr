## Configuration

The first thing to remind myself of - the minimal set for `rmarkdown::render_site()` to work is:

* a `_site.yml` file
* an `index.(R)md` file

It would be a neat exercise to have someone in suggest a theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/).

In `_site.yml` The stuff you can put into yml underneath `html_document:` corresponds to arguments made to `rmarkdown::html_document()`.

Good idea to add:

```
  html_document:
    self_contained: false
    lib_dir: site_libs
```

## New page

1. Create `new_page.Rmd` (I like to use new text file)

2. Put in title yml

3. Add to the navbar.

4. Create the content.

## Deployment

When deploying your site keep in mind if you are using gh-pages or are using something else.

If `gh-pages`, use `output_dir: "."`, put in `.nojekyll`. If not, use `output_dir: _site`.

## Advice

Usual helpful and timely advice from Jenny Bryan:

Great stuff here, on particularly on troubleshooting.

The rprojroot package is your friend.

## Demo?

Maybe show the SE "Dryer Data" work as a sample.

## Question 

Can we create dependencies between Rmd files and data? Gotta find a better way to put this.

Use File > New > RMarkdown > Shiny 

Can mix shiny and websites - copy this to a new directory and put `runtime: shiny` into each Rmd's yml. Then take out `self-contained` and `lib_dir` from `html_document:`

Knit button turns into a run app button, uses shiny on local computer.

Can deploy site to shinyapps.io as an app. (at least you could in 2014)

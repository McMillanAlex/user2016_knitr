```{r}
library("htmltools")
library("vembedr") # on cran
```

Of course, embedding a video is useful only for html-based outputs.

To center the embed, my first thought is to try `fig.align='center'`:

```{r fig.align='center'}
embed_vimeo(110804387)
```

This does not work for me.

I *can* get it to work by using htmltools functions.

```{r}
tags$div(align = "center", embed_vimeo(110804387))
```
 
Is there a knitr-friendly way to do this?
